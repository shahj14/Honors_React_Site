            <p>My freshman year was absolutely amazing in regard to the organizations I joined, the work experiences I received, and the events that I attended.
                Going into college I had no idea what to expect about all of this. But after one year in college, I must say, it was way better than I expected.</p>

            <p>I wanted to start college by joining a few organizations to make new friends and test the waters. I probably signed up for 15 clubs at the Main Street fair
                but I didn't stick with any of those. I ended up being a part of the Engineering Tribunal Mentorship Program which allows a few students to learn more about
                how the Engineering College functions and serves as a good transition to a leadership role. I met some great people and friends through this organizations
                which resulted in me wanting to be more involved in organizations on campus. When Spring semester came around I was able to join UC Dance Marathon and Engineering
                Ambassadors. After a few meetings in UCDM I was appointed the role of Fundraising Director which is a very large responsibility with the goal of raising
                $100,000 for this year. I have had an excellent experience in my involvement so far at UC and there's a chance I may make a bigger leap in the Fall.</p>

            <p>Entering college, I thought fraternities were a horrible idea for myself due to how they are portrayed in the media. However, I ended up checking out a few
                Greek organizations during rush week and joined a fraternity, Beta Theta Pi. This has been one of the best decisions I have made in my short college career.
                I have met some of my best friends and had amazing memories through Beta. I had the opportunity to attend the Wooden Leadership Institute (hosted by Beta) at
                Oxford, OH in the summer of 2017 and I learned a lot about myself as both a person and a leader. Being a fraternity man has instilled great values in me and
                made me even more loyal to the University of Cincinnati.</p>

            <p>Rounding out my 1st year, I have picked up amazing work experience in the field of Software Development. In the spring I had a 14 week, 20 hours a week internship
                at GE Digital where I was able to do Web Development and create a full stack application that incorporated Google Maps API, Javascript, and HTML5/CSS3. I met some
                very intelligent individuals who gave me great advice in the field which made me want to return for the summer. This summer I am currently in the middle of a 14 week
                full time internship working 40 hours a week. I am working on creating multiple web applications using the Angular2 framework and also working on a Tableau dashboard.
                The people here at GE Digital have been great in every regard and have helped me gain skills to better my career.</p>

            <p>My 1st year of college was amazing and there is really nothing I would do differently. I highly recommend getting involved and gaining work experience as soon as possible.</p>
